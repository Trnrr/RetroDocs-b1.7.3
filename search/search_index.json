This isn't unexpected with this release being over 10 years old. But what was unexpected was the amount of plugins missing from the original bukkit website. Major versions seem to have just been wiped out completely. In addition to that there are some community discord servers that only have plugins hosted in them. This is frustrating since you can't search for this information without first finding the server. Stop using Discord to archive content! </p> <p>I want a website/wiki/form/something that allows you to easily locate information related to this version. This is my attempt at that. We'll be linking to existing docs where possible and filling in the gaps when needed. CB and plugin jars will be hosted somewhere easibly locatable. The current idea is to use https://glass-repo.net when the plugin license permits and a github archive repo when it doesn't. Eitherway, have a location where users can find the information they need.</p>"},{"location":"#beta-173-server-lists","title":"Beta 1.7.3 Server Lists","text":"<p>https://legacytracker.xyz/ &amp; https://servers.api.legacyminecraft.com/ can be used to find some Beta 1.7.3 servers.
