# Welcome to RetroDocs-b1.7.3 (name not final lol)

## WIP WIP WIP WIP WIP WIP WIP WIP WIP WIP WIP WIP

## Project Goals
The end goal of this project is to create a place where users can easily find server and plugin information for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3. 

To do this the general thought is to compile existing and build new documentation where needed. The scope currently is to cover server software and plugins for Minecraft beta 1.7.3 version of craftbukkit CB1060. 

1. Locate CB1060 and any active Forks (ex: Project-Poseidon).
2. Find and locate the latest version of plugins compatible with CB1060.
3. For Server files and Plugins
    1. Provide a download or a place to locate each. 
        1. Currently considering using [https://glass-repo.net](https://glass-repo.net)
    2. Locate related information and if needed, create new documentation to fill in the gaps where possible.
        1. Setting up a server, Usage basics, Configuration, Permissions, YouTube tutorials, etc


Ideally I would like to try and grow this into a community effort. Any feedback is welcome and all pages are currently very work in progress. Nothing is final at this stage.


## Why?
When trying to create a Beta 1.7.3 server I grew increasingly frustrated at the amount of dead links I would come across. This isn't unexpected with this release being over 10 years old. But what was unexpected was the amount of plugins missing from the original bukkit website. Major versions seem to have just been wiped out completely. In addition to that there are some community discord servers that only have plugins hosted in them. This is frustrating since you can't search for this information without first finding the server. Stop using Discord to archive content! 

I want a website/wiki/form/something that allows you to easily locate information related to this version. This is my attempt at that. We'll be linking to existing docs where possible and filling in the gaps when needed. CB and plugin jars will be hosted somewhere easibly locatable. The current idea is to use [https://glass-repo.net](https://glass-repo.net) when the plugin license permits and a github archive repo when it doesn't. Eitherway, have a location where users can find the information they need.


## Beta 1.7.3 Server Lists

[https://legacytracker.xyz/](https://legacytracker.xyz/) & [https://servers.api.legacyminecraft.com/](https://servers.api.legacyminecraft.com/) can be used to find some Beta 1.7.3 servers. This is just a small subset that have their plugin installed.
