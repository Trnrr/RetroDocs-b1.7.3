## Basic Usage
Lockette allows users to lock chests.

While holding a sign, right click on a chest. This will place the sign on the chest and your username will be listed on line 2. You can add additional users by right clicking on the sign and then typing `/lockette 3 FriendsName`. You can also attach more signs to the chest to increase the user count.
